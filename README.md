# Kaggle_Titanic
Kaggle_Titanic_2021_Aug represents my first attempt to script a complete Python notebook as a means to learn a new coding language.
My approach was to utilize the quintessential learning data set -- Titanic survivorship on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Following numerous online posts on Titanic was a tremendous way to learn data cleansing, imputation, feature engineering, and data transformation.
I also wanted to try out a couple methods for EDA (Pandas Profiling and SweetViz) as well as AutoML (PyCaret and h2o).
I experimented with Jupyter and Colab notebooks; ultimately opting for Colab.
Once my code was complete (enough), I established my first GitHub repository to learn about this tool.

I'd like to continue imporving this code overtime as I learn Python. Next, I'd like to learn more charting techniques in order to draw out more insights in both statistical description and from AutoML outputs.
